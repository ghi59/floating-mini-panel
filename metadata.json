Move the Mini Panel by dragging it with the handle button. Moving it over screen edges, will align it to the edges. Click the handle button to show AppGrid with the Main Panel. A right click will hide the Mini Panel for 5 sec, so you can reach obstructed window elements.\n\nNow with support for System-, Extension- and AppIndicators! Use middle-click on Handle Button to open/close the Drawer and on Extension Indicators to move them between Drawer and Always-Visible-Area.",
