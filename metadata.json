  "description": "A movable and always-on-top Mini Panel with just DateMenu and QuickSettings.\n<< Work maximized or fullscreen and stay informed about time and your system >>\n\nWhen enabled it hides the Main Panel and shows itself instead. Move the Mini Panel by dragging it with the handle button. Moving it over screen edges, will align it to the edges. Click the handle button to show AppGrid with the Main Panel. A right click will hide the Mini Panel for 5 sec, so you can reach obstructed window elements.\n\nNow with support for System-, Extension- and AppIndicators! Use middle-click on Handle Button to open/close the Drawer and on Extension Indicators to move them between Drawer and Always-Visible-Area.\n\nThe newest enhancements are Default Positions, Dynamic Border Edges and a Menu, which is reachable via a Right Button Longpress on the handle button. Upgrading from version 6 your customized position will be reset to Top-Left, because of improved alingment handling.\n\nAttention:\nWhen installing for the first time or disable/enable accross sessions, you have to logout and login again, because this extension relies on the GNOME Shell 'startup-complete' signal to function correctly!",
