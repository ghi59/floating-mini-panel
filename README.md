## Introduction

Floating Mini Panel replaces the Gnome Main Panel with a movable and always-on-top`Mini Panel` with just the DateMenu and QuickSettings. Both menus are fully functional and behave like expected. The `Mini Panel`can be moved anywhere on the desktop by dragging it with the handle button. It will align itself, when dragged over screen edges. A click on the handle button will show AppGrid together with the Gnome Main Panel. To reach obscured window or desktop elements it can be hidden for 5 seconds by right clicking the handle button, or simply moved out of the way.

## Motivation

Working most of the time with Laptops, every inch of display space is important. Hiding the Main Panel or going into Fullscreen are ways to gain space. But then Intelli-Hide-Features may disturb or Fullscreen has to be toggled. With the `Mini Panel` nothing of this is needed for working maximized, staying informed about time and system status and having important functions available.

### Usage

Simply enable Floating Mini Panel via QuickSettings menu and place it very you prefer.
